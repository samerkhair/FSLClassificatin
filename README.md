# FSLC - Fingerspelling Sign Language Classification 

In this 
In this project, we used a classifier trained on deep learning skills to try to translate a video displaying a spelled sign language word to an English word.
Given ten videos with ten different words spelled sign by sign, our classifier predicted almost all of them while failing on only two.

This is a class project for the Technion's EE046211 - Deep Learning course.
